<p><strong>COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#e67e22">What is a cookie?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises&nbsp;that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user&#39;s device.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cookies help us to improve our site and to deliver better and more personalised&nbsp;service, for instance by storing information about your preferences and allowing&nbsp;us to recognise you when you return to our site. You may refuse to accept cookies</p>

<p>by activating settings on your internet browser. However, please note that if you select such settings certain parts of our site may not work properly.</p>

<p>The information we collect may include IP addresses, browser version, number of&nbsp;visits, which pages you access and your viewing preferences. Information on the duration of the cookies.</p>

<p>We use the following categories of cookies on our website:</p>

<p><strong>Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies are essential to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these&nbsp;cookies, services you have asked for, like any shopping basket items cannot be&nbsp;provided. We don&rsquo;t use these cookies to gather information about you that could be used for profiling, advertising or remembering where you&#39;ve been on the internet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Category 2: Performance Cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies collect information on how visitors use our website. For example,&nbsp;</p>

<p>which pages visitors go to most often, and if you get error messages from web&nbsp;pages. These cookies don&#39;t collect information that identifies you as a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.</p>

<p><strong>Category 3: Functionality Cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies remember choices you make such as the country you visit our website from, language or the region you are in. These can then be used to provide you with an experience more appropriate to your selections and to make the visits&nbsp;more tailored and pleasant. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>

<p><strong>Category 4: Targeting cookies or advertising cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies collect information about your browsing habits to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit&nbsp;the number of times you see an advert as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. The cookies are usually placed by third-party&nbsp;</p>

<p>advertising networks with the website operator&#39;s permission. They remember the websites you visit and that information is shared with other parties such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</p>

<p><strong>Category 5: Social Media Cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies allow you to share what you&rsquo;ve been doing on the website on social media such as Pinterest, Facebook and Twitter. These cookies are not within our control. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities. Please refer to the respective social media&rsquo;s privacy policies for how their cookies work.</p>

<p>Cookies within the above Categories may include those shown on the table&nbsp;with their respective website locations showing you how to opt-out of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Use of Web Beacons</strong></p>

<p>Some of our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons,&nbsp;among other things, that allow us to count users who have visited these pages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Web beacons collect only limited information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web page resides.&nbsp;We may also carry web beacons placed by third-party advertisers. These beacons&nbsp;do not carry any personally identifiable information and are only used to track the&nbsp;effectiveness of a particular campaign.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Consent to Cookies</strong></p>

<p>To place cookies on your device, we require your consent. If you don&rsquo;t want to receive cookies at all, you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that if you continue to browse the site, you will be considered to have&nbsp;agreed to our use of cookies.</p>

<p>You can withdraw your consent to our use of cookies at any time. If you wish to&nbsp;restrict or block web browser cookies that have been set on your device, then you&nbsp;can do this through your browser settings; the Help function within your browser&nbsp;should tell you how. You can also use your browser settings to delete cookies that&nbsp;have already been set.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may wish to visit www.aboutcookies.org, which contains&nbsp;comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of desktop&nbsp;browsers. However, please note that if you select such settings you may be unable&nbsp;to access certain parts of our site or certain content or functionality may not be&nbsp;available.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to opt-out of other third party cookies relating to behavioural&nbsp;advertising, please go to www.youronlinechoices.eu. Opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.</p>

<p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>

<p>Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your data for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we can send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests. You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time. You can do this by following the</p>

<p>instructions in the communication where this is an electronic message.</p>

<p>You have the right to ask us for a copy of your data; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your data; and to obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured,&nbsp;</p>

<p>machine-readable format.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, you can object to the processing of your data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don&rsquo;t have to process the data to meet a&nbsp;</p>

<p>contractual or other legal requirements, or where we are using the data for direct marketing).&nbsp;</p>

<p>These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal&nbsp;</p>

<p>personal data about another person, where it would infringe the rights of a third&nbsp;</p>

<p>party (including our rights), or if you ask us to delete information which we are&nbsp;</p>

<p>required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping.</p>
