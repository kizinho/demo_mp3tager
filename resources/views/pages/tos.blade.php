                                    these Agreements, whether written or oral. Any additional or different terms or
                                    conditions in relation to the subject matter of the Agreements in any written or
                                    oral communication from you to Mp3tager are void. You represent that you have not
                                    accepted the Agreements in reliance on any oral or written representations made by
                                    Mp3tager that are not contained in the Agreements.
                                </p>

                                    Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the Mp3tager Service may be
                                    governed by additional agreements. That could include, for example, access to the
                                    Mp3tager Community for customer support, access to the Mp3tager Service as a result
                                    of a gift card, or free or discounted Trials. You will agree to separate terms and
                                    conditions in those circumstances, which are listed in full here. Those terms and
                                    conditions shall govern only with regard to the aspect of the Service to which they
                                    apply, and are distinct from and supplemental to these Agreements, and do not
                                    supersede these Agreements. To the extent that there is any conflict between those
                                    agreements and these Agreements, these Agreements shall control, except as otherwise
                                    provided in these Terms
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Occasionally we may offer you the chance to participate in sweepstakes, contests,
                                    and surveys (“Special Promotions”) through the Service. Special Promotions may be
                                    governed by terms and conditions that are separate from these Terms. If the
                                    provisions of a Special Promotion’s terms and conditions conflict with these Terms,
                                    those separate terms and conditions shall prevail.

                                    or any other jurisdiction, these Agreements are subject to the laws of Sweden,
                                    without regard to choose or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and Mp3tager
                                    agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden to resolve any dispute,
                                    claim or controversy that arises in connection with these Agreements.

                                    If you are a United States user, the following mandatory arbitration provisions also
                                    apply to you:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You and Mp3tager agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
                                    relating in any way to the Mp3tager Service or your use thereof, including our
                                    Agreements, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree that the
                                    U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
                                    provision, and that you and Mp3tager are each waiving the right to a trial by jury
                                    and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action. This arbitration
                                    provision shall survive termination of these Agreements and the termination of your
                                    Mp3tager account. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration
                                    Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American
                                    Arbitration Association (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by these Agreements, and as
                                    administered by the AAA. You and Mp3tager agree that these Agreements involve
                                    interstate commerce and are subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You and Mp3tager agree that (a) any claims seeking to enforce, protect, or determine
                                    the validity or ownership of any intellectual property rights, and (b) any claims
                                    related to allegations of theft, piracy or unauthorized use of the Mp3tager Service
                                    are NOT subject to mandatory arbitration. Instead, you and Mp3tager agree that these
                                    claims (including but not limited to claims for injunctive or equitable relief)
                                    shall be exclusively decided by courts of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco
                                    County, California or New York, New York, and that applicable California and/or
                                    Federal law shall govern, without regard to choose of law principles.

                                    YOU AND MP3TAGER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR
                                    ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY
                                    OR PROCEEDING. Further, no arbitrator shall consolidate any other person’s claims
                                    with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or
                                    class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any
                                    way, then the entirety of this arbitration section shall be null and void. The
                                    arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA
                                    within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or
                                    reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim; and
                                    there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time
                                    period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting
                                    claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by
                                    applicable law. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will
                                    be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules with the remainder
                                    paid by Mp3tager. Any arbitration costs or fees deemed “excessive” will be paid by
                                    Mp3tager.
